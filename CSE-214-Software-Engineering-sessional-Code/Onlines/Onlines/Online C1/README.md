## Online on Creational Pattern

**Time: 25 minutes**

In an e-commerce application, different payment methods are accepted (e.g., ***Credit card***,
***PayPal***, and ***Cryptocurrency*** like Bitcoin). As the business expands, new payment methods
may be introduced and existing ones may undergo changes. The system should be designed to
accommodate these changes without modifying the existing codebase.

You have to implement the payment *interface* where a user can choose their preferred method
of payment and pay using that method. The classes that represent the payment methods will
contain a function to process the payment. A message ensuring successful payment will be
shown on the screen.
